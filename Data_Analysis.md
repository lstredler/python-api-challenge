#Three Observations on Data

#1) Latitude vs Temperate Plot - This scatter plot shows that cities closest to the equator, or at 0 degrees, expereince the highest maximum temperatures. 
#2) Latitude vs Wind Speed - There appears to be no consistent correlation between wind speed and latitude. There is no consistent pattern based on the scatter plot. Most cities experience average wind speed around 10 mph. 
#3) Southern Hemisphere Humidity vs Latitude - This scatter plot shows there is a direct correlation and upward trend for humidity vs latitude.  Cities that are higher above the equator (higher in latitude) experience higher humidity.
